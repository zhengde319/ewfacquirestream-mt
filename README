I'm modified the following code:
* ewfacquirestream-mt Project.

a) The following parts are added to fix link errors, when the project is built.
- Add "..\..\libodraw, ..\..\libsmdec, ..\..\libsmraw, ..\..\libvalue, ..\..\libfdata, ..\..\libcache" to "\C/C++\General\Additional Include Directories" of Property Pages on ewfacquirestream-mt project
- Add "HAVE_LOCAL_LIBODRAW, HAVE_LOCAL_LIBSMDEV, HAVE_LOCAL_LIBSMRAW, HAVE_LOCAL_LIBFVALUE, HAVE_LOCAL_LIBFDATA, HAVE_LOCAL_LIBFCACHE" to "\C/C++\Preprocessor\Preprocessor Definitions" of Property Pages on ewfacquirestream-mt project
- Add line 59 in threading.hpp (int verbose_messages)

b) The following codes were added to track errors. 
- Add line 235 in ewfacquirestream.c ( uint8_t read_error_retries)
- Add line 244, 255 in ewfacquirestream.c ( int32_t read_number_of_errors = 0; uint32_t read_error_offset = 0; )
- Add line 657, 658 in ewfacquirestream.c ( read_error_retries, acquiry_count,)

c) The following codes were added into the source code.
- Add line 458 in ewfacquirestream.c ( uint8_t print_status_information; )
- Add line 980, 984 in ewfacquirestream.c (uint8_t print_status_information = 1; uint8_t verbose = 0; )
- Add line 1777 in ewfacquirestream.c ( read_error_retries )

d) The errors were fixed, when reading the data.
- Modify line 334 ~ 448 in ewfacquirestream.c
